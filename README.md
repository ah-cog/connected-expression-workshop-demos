# Prerequisites

These sketches were written for Processing 3. They require the [Minim](https://github.com/ddf/Minim) library and the [Video](https://github.com/processing/processing-video). To install Minim, click the "Download ZIP" button on its GitHub page and extract it to the "Processing/libraries/Minim" folder. To install the Video library, first open Processing 3, then select *Sketch > Import Library... > Add Library...* then select the "Video" library.
